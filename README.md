# thingamaPRO

Order at your own risk, even i fuck up too often. Maybe poke at me for help but for the most part you are on your own if you do decide to order these.
This projecet was created to do the stupid thing I wanted and I got mine.

Goals of the project is to give as one to one a switch pro feel for ultimate on a gcc/phob interface. Anything past that is a nice bonus(melee or people calibrating to their own prefrences).

I highly implore you to calibrate either to the 3dp jig(and follow reccommended offsets or test for your own(except cstick that one is pretty bang on already)) or use some octo shell to calibrate before putting circle gates on these as otherwise the sticks will feel like dogshit and that's on you or whoever made you the thingamapro and you should yell at them.

Some things to absolutely not forget when ordering:

Front boards are 0.8mm thick and need gold finish to work at their best, ill probably chuck some of my bstock stuff for cheap on etsy if you dont want to drop 80 on 5 standard assembly boards

Main PCB is 1.2mm thick and you can do the regular finish as none are in the context of contact pads


Warnings aside the files I have supplied are only really a start since I personally dont want to say use this part or that part and tank the stuff i use over multiple designs so you will need a couple bit more brain cells to actually part out the boards properly. 

So for instance you will need to format the position file properly for jlc to be able to read it and also you need to double check all of the parts are on the right orientation(if someone wants to do this for me feel free since even i dont bother and i tinker with it too much). For the bom it should be descript enough that you can figure out the parts from looking at lcsc so have fun there.
